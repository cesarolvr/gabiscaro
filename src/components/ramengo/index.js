            Some months ago I was invited by the front end team of Red Ventures
            to create a new practical test for candidates who'd apply for a job
            opening. I gave wings to the imagination and I created a delivery
            platform in which the users could choose the ingredients for their
            ramen and receive it at the comfort of their homes. I developed all
            the visuals: styleguide, interaction and illustrations/iconography.

            I brought these insights I discovered to the Business and Tech team
            in an ideation session I conducted. I presented all the data and the
            user flow and they gave some ideas of how we might solve these
            problems. üî• A lot of cool ideas came up, for example:
          </p>
          <ul className="sectionlist">
            <li>
              As iq is a marketplaces and intermediate the credit card
              application process, could be that a lot of people feel insecure
              about the iq's role. So, we could include some step by step of how
              this application process works;\
            </li>
            <li>
              How long the credit card application process will take. Here in
              Brazil, this process could happen whitin a month, so a lot of
              people get impatient waiting a bank's or iq's response;
            </li>
            <li>
              Update the whole page with our design system: some buttons and
              typography are different from each other, so this could cause a
              insecurity sense by the users.

            I invited some of my fellow designer colleagues at Red Ventures to
            join me in a Design Critique Session. Many of them had previous
            experience working with conversion in credit card pages and
            application forms in one of the Red Ventures partnerships, so they
            have A LOT of experience with the target users who are interested in
            credit cards.
          </p>
          <p className="sectionparagraph">
            I divided the session it two parts:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul className="sectionlist -number">
            <li>
              In the first part, I asked for them ‚ÄùWhat are the most important
              features of the card that people need to know in the first 30
              seconds?‚Äù They were unanimous in deciding three common things
              about the credit card that should appear first in the page:
              Information about the annuity; Time until the approval and
              receivement; And the credit limit.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              The second part, I presented the two concepts (gifs above) and
              they were free to gave their opinions about what I designed. The
              version A (with the accordion) was everybody‚Äôs favorite and they
              gave me a lot of insights about what I could do differently:
              <ul className="sectionlist">
                <li>
                  Promote the session about the bank account. (If the user have
                  a bank account in the credit card's bank, they could earn a
                  lower minimum income asked);
                </li>
                <li>Be more playful with the typography sizes and weights;</li>
                <li>
                  For experience in one of the partnerships, two buttons convert
                  more than one fixed on the bottom. So, they suggested two
                  buttons instead of one. And add one more button anchoring to
                  the FAQ session;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Create a layout with the bank's colors. So, the user would
                  feel that he is doing the same flow when redirected to the
                  bank's page, consequently trusting more in iq's page.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

            I implemented some insights that the others designers gave me, for
            example: two buttons in the same page convert more than one; Add an
            anchorage button to the FAQ session; Highlight the session about
            bank account, etc...
