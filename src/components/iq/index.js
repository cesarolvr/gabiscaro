              iq was a lot of things, it was an automatic credit card payment
              service for utility bills (energy, gas, telephone, internet, etc),
              but also a Credit Card Marketplace. After a bunch of tests, the
              Marketplace page stopped converting how the Directors and Product
              Managers expected.

            I brought these insights I discovered to the Business and Tech team
            in an ideation session I conducted. I presented all the data and the
            user flow and they gave some ideas of how we might solve these
            problems. üî• A lot of cool ideas came up, for example:

          <ul className="sectionlist">
            <li>
              Since iq is a marketplace and intermediates the credit card
              application process, the concern is that a lot of people feel
              insecure about iq's role. So, we could include a step by step
              showing how this application process works;
            </li>
            <li>
              How long the credit card application process will take. Here in
              Brazil, this process could happen whitin a month, so a lot of
              people get impatient waiting for the bank's or iq's response;
            </li>
            <li>
              Update the whole page with our design system: some buttons and
              typography are different from each other, so this could evoke
              insecurity in users.

            I invited some of my fellow designer colleagues at Red Ventures to
            join me in a Design Critique Session. Many of them had previous
            experience working with conversion in credit card pages and
            application forms in one of the Red Ventures partnerships, so they
            have A LOT of experience with the target users who are interested in
            credit cards.
          </p>
          <p className="sectionparagraph">
            I divided the session into two parts:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul className="sectionlist -number">
            <li>
              In the first part, I asked them ‚ÄùWhat are the most important
              features of the card that people need to know in the first 30
              seconds?‚Äù They were unanimous in deciding three common things
              about the credit card that should appear first in the page:
              <br />
              <p>a. Information about the annuity;</p>
              <p>b. Time period until the approval and delivery;</p>
              <p>c. And the credit limit.</p>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              In the second part, I presented the two concepts (gifs above) and
              they were free to gave their opinions about what I designed.
              Version A (with the accordion) was everybody‚Äôs favorite and they
              gave me a lot of insights about what I could do differently:
              <ul className="sectionlist">
                <li>
                  Promote the session about the bank account. (If the user has a
                  bank account in the credit card's bank, they could be asked
                  for a lower minimum income;

                  From past experience in one of the partnerships, two buttons
                  convert more than one fixed on the bottom. So, they suggested
                  two buttons instead of one. And add one more button anchoring
                  to the FAQ section;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Create a layout with the bank's colors. So, the user would
                  feel that they are continuing in the same flow when redirected
                  to the bank's page, consequently gaining trust in iq's page.

            I implemented some insights that the others designers gave me, for
            example: two buttons in the same page convert more than one; Add an
            anchorage button to the FAQ section; Highlight the section about
            bank account, etc...
